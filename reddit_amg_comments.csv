"Good review

> So many people go on and on about how fast the throttle response is on naturally aspirated cars, but to be honest every turbocharged car I’ve driven has felt way faster than a naturally aspirated car at a comparable power level

I think for a lot of people its not response but rather linearity and delivery, with NA its constant for a given input, with turbo you add another variable that is influenced but not direct to your throttle, its like having a 2d vs. 3d table in your head.

Of course turbo designs have significantly improved over the past few decades and the 911 in particular has a design that is more than linear enough but it still stands true in some capacity for cheaper models

> mushy

Can't say I've experienced that, especially in the sportier drive modes, if anything it was too much of a kick (and I believe they turned down the sport+ tuning)

Same with the suspension, if anything I found it too compliant on my old 911. It was incredibly comfortable yet well tracked for what was supposed to be a track-oriented car (gt3)

> The challenge is at $140K+ you can buy a small collection of cars that collectively are more dynamic, comfortable, and easy to drive.

This is annecdotal but most of the new 911 owners I know have it as either their only car or their only sports car, and get a new one on lease like clockwork. Not everyone has the space, time, etc. for multiple cars, now I have to deal with maintaining and insuring 3 instead of 1

> used supercar 

I don't think its really fair to compare new vs. used regardless, as you can just buy a used 911 as well for cheaper or a higher trim for the same money as new

> it is nice find something that truly checks so many boxes

IMO this is kind of what explains the steering, suspension, ""floaty"" feel etc. Its almost like they set out to make objectively the best car every time. Its not my cup of tea nowadays nor is it reasonable for most folks when the C8 is around. But I do think despite the competition time and time again they slightly edge everyone out. 

Not on value, if you want that just get a c8 z51, but I'm not surprised in the slightest why people love the targa4 so much, somehow porsche always threads that line between gt and sportscar better than anyone else.",reddit_cars
"You can't judge a ""mushy"" transmission when you are operating it in faux-manual mode. In true automatic mode, the PDK is unmatched.

In manual mode, I agree, but it's easily fixable. 

When you talk about the PDK having a mushy response, it doesn't. It has a lag between actuating the paddles and it shifting, and the paddles themselves (on non GT/RS versions) aren't very tactile.

M Engineering offers a PDK tune that makes the engine actually respond when you pull the paddles, and you can get RS Magnesium paddles for like $600. Completely different experience.

I say this as someone who daily'd a 992 Carrera S for 2 years.",reddit_cars
lol at the empty flairs doubting OP bc apparently not automatically thinking Porsches are the best thing ever made means his opinion is invalid. Doubly so when he lists the cars he’s driven and it’s a pretty extensive list of amazing stuff most here will never even sit in let alone drive.,reddit_cars
I’m personally a Cayman > 911 guy and honestly I’d much rather own a Z51 C8 than a 992 Carrera S but I really think you just don’t like 911’s that much if at all my man,reddit_cars
Bro damn that’s a huge review,reddit_cars
Great review. Felt like a good glimpse into the 911 from a non-fan perspective. ,reddit_cars
Your first couple sentences make me wary of everything you wrote.,reddit_cars
"IMO a lot of the handling stuff is in the GT models. When I first got my base carrera (991 not the new one), my first thought was “arent these cars suppose to be fkn fast?” 

And NOPE. Not at all. For the money you’d probably compare an S/base with like a c8 or a bmw or something but they are totally different. The new porsches seem to be more grand touring and feel boaty at times. And flex pieces for people who got cash to throw.

When you get a good alignment is when it starts to really fly. Toe out, camber in the front and the front end comes alive. Porsche is still in the business of selling cars, so they gotta give u the shitty version until you pay big money for a GT car. Closest you’ll ever get is a carrera T or GTS with the sport suspension and aggressive alignment. 

I obviously have a modded carrera and i wouldnt trade it for any 992/718/C8 unless its like the RS equivalent lol. When you have everything right the fun comes alive. The front end bites like its dragging the whole car into the turn, while the rear follows through. And when you have some extra grip in the front and throttle thru the rear rotates around the front, hooks, then rockets out. Absolute beauty. But yeah you’ll never get that off the lot with non GT porsche!!",reddit_cars
"A 911 is a super car you can daily drive. You can also drive it to the local track, drive it hard, and it won’t break. Not everyone gets it but it’s a real sports car and not a toy.",reddit_cars

Takeaway: 911s (Porsche?) aren’t worth the money they are commanding. At least in the US. ///M > Porsche. I could buy two of my G8x BMWs for one decently speced 911. It’s ridiculous. 911s are for geriatrics anyway that can only drive to cars and coffee. 🤣,reddit_cars

But….I’ve seen suggestions based on how ZR1 did on other tracks when you compare relative times of other cars that did those tracks and Nurburgring, it should be around like 6:45-50 (considering it’s about 2 sec faster than the GT2RS at VIR and Watkins Glen, which did 6:47 at Nurburgring).  But the C8 Z06 was in the same realm as the GT2RS at the US tracks but ended up 7:12 at Nurburgring.

So, no idea what will happen.  Sub 7 is the obvious goal but I think:

Maserati, Mercedes, and Range Rover do offer PTS type programs with Fuoserie, Manufaktur and SV Bespoke respectively. As you mentioned its cheating a bit so it wouldn't change the end results, but you can paint your G-Wagon any color you wish! For a pretty penny of course

I don't know what the price tag is on that right now, but with mercedes on the previous gen s-class coupes, it was 2.5k + somewhere in the 8-10k range for the paint itself. Compared to PTS pricing and maserati's tri-coats, bit of a steal",reddit_cars

"I think the general gist of what you said is pretty accurate. I often tell people it's the best car I've ever owned, but it's not my favorite. It's a much more muted experience then you would expect from the price tag, but that's McLaren's thing though. They are built to be objectively the best driving cars you can buy on the market. The best just doesn't always translates into ""fun"".


Some things I do disagree with; 


I know what you mean by the braking. It feels like you're stepping on a wooden block and there's no feel to it. It's very weird at first. However overtime you get use to them and once I put the car around the track every other car's braking felt like garbage. My Emiras brakes feel like they came out of a 98 Toyota Corolla now, which is insane to me. You just gotta get use to them.


The McLarens tech is all new and quite frankly mind blowing. Its slow because its a first of it's kind integration using ethernet connectivity to communicate between itself. The reason being, McLaren thought wiring harnesses weighed too much... that's right, copper was too heavy to put in their car, so McLaren from scratch created a system that removed 70% of all wiring. So yeah, it's a little slow, but its the price you pay for extreme weight savings.


Mushy acceleration, again I know exactly what you mean. It doesn't really hit you and the sensation of speed feels really disconnected. However, I race all my cars because I'm fun like that, and despite feeling slower than my Z06, it absolutely destroys it. You don't feel like you are moving as fast as you should be, but you are. Feels like a bullet train. As for my 750s, yea, that car is and feels quicker from 0 to about 80, but on the track say from 80 to 140 they are practically accelerating at the same rate. The 750s just feels more wicked of how that engine spools.  


Brake steer: You gotta turn that traction control off. If you just hit the ESC button once you still have traction control enabled (vdc), gotta hold it down for a bit to turn it all the way off. Not only does the car handle so much better, but it actually accelerates a lot harder, because you're actually putting that power to the ground.


Price: Honestly, it's a better value then the 750s. It's practically the best daily exotic you can buy at any price point. We tend to over hype ourselves about exotics, but they're still just cars and there's only so much of an experience you can get driving a production car on the streets regardless of price. Once you are over 100k that feeling of excitement diminishes greatly especially since the Z06 exists.


Insurance is cheap for me. I pay 378 a month. The Z06 for example is 162. So given the MSRP it's compable. 


I'm actually not a fan of the steering. I don't find it really gives all that much feedback, but I'm spoiled with the Lotus. The handling however is the most rock stable car I've ever owned. The steering just feels bland to me.


Things I agree with;


That engine sound really is meh and I have the performance exhaust. My wife loves it and I just don't get it. It's not particularly pleasant, it kind of just drones all the way to redline. Sounds good on the outside though I suppose. 


That EV power delivery is weird and abrupt sometimes. I personally just think hybrids sound good on paper, but often disrupt the experience.


Don't over leverage on any car. It is really not worth the experience. I can't stress this enough. Cars like McLaren, Ferrari, and Lamborghini exist in this extreme space where people are willing to pay a disaportionate amount of money for meager gains. This is true with any product like you said, whether it's clothing or food. This is where I love recommending the Z06. That car, for its price, is the best bang for the buck/ imitation of an exotic you can get. Is it better then the Artura? Nope (except for that glorious engine), but it doesn't have to be. It just needs to be good enough to get you close to that sensation.


Great write up. Thanks for the informative feedback.",reddit_cars
"\> \*\*Engaging gear shifts \*\* I found the gear shifts in the Artura to be properly engaging. 

One thing you didn't mention and one of my favorite McLaren features, you can push the paddle both ways. It is incredibly convenient being able to drive in manual mode but take one hand off the wheel once in a while and not have to put it back in auto constantly. 

Also worth noting you can get a solid lease deals on these, they ironically qualify for the $7.5k tax credit due to the nature of the regs, dealers will knockoff a good bit more because mclaren makes a shitload of these and hates residuals, the '23 and '24 models have issue but can be sorted with patience and can be found on steep discount

For $300k? Absolutely not, but for closer to $200k it's not a bad buy at all. The car itself is actually fantastic for the price. It's just you'll have to put up with the mclaren ownership experience :tm: (which has improved, but is still far below what you expect at that price point).",reddit_cars

"Quick answer: No. It would step on the toes of more expensive/profitable models from a performance perspective.

They won't put a turbo on the BRZ/GR86 because it would be better than the base Supra, and realistically a turbo version would only cost like $1,500-$2,000 more, but because they'd lose sales on the base Supra they'd need to jack the price the at least 5k more, and then it wouldn't sell because it would be competing with the aftermarket where you have more control.

The current WRX with literally only a tune puts out \~290whp and that's with the AWD drivetrain losses. You'd probably see over \~300whp in the GR86/BRZ with only a tune. This vehicle would also step on the WRX's toes a little probably too, and so that's another reason they'll never release it.

Mazda is pursuing lightness above all else in the Miata, to me it'd be better if the engine had more character in its context than a turbocharger.

  
TL;DR: Essentially the issue is that it's too good and nobody would buy anything else, so anybody with a sporty offering in the lineup wouldn't make it as it would cannibalize their own sales. Honestly I feel like if they weren't in the shitter Nissan could pull it off since they have the Silvia heritage to fall back on.

"They screwed the pooch with the c63 that was supposed to serve as the pattern for AMG going forward (relatively small ice engine, larger assist from hybrid setup) and had to rethink the next launches to avoid a similar fate. Hence no e63s for this generation. 

The coming CLS63 with the new v8 is a last minute addition to try and salvage this generation of top end AMGs. It’s going to be wicked but I’d worry about growing pains with the engine in early model years given the need for a fast development timeline. Buy this one after the mid cycle update.

AMG needs to follow BMW or Porsche’s lead with hybrid philosophy. Those brands still use a batshit crazy ICE engines in their top models. The hybrid units just serve to make them even crazier.",reddit_cars

"I feel like the Honda Fit and Insight will both be looked back on very fondly as small, light, and quirky cars in the same way as the Honda City Turbo and Acty are today. 

My obligatory answer is the first-gen Audi TT - that car is a design icon that hasn't been appreciated properly yet. The A2 falls into the same category, IMO.  They both just had the misfortune of coming out right before the shift to ""aggressive,"" masculine designs. Both of the cars were seen as too feminine, and this was ultimately their downfall, especially because the TT was actively advertised as a fashion accessory at the time, both having a Neiman Marcus edition and appearing in Legally Blonde 2. 

Something tells me, even though they're
not my style, that the modern-retro cars like the SSR, HHR, PT Cruiser, and Plymouth Prowler will all have nostalgic comebacks. Maybe even the last-gen Thunderbird, if we're getting really crazy. 

Toyota, realistically, doesn't have many groundbreaking post-2000's designs. However, like always, I think their truck offerings like the Tacoma and 4Runner will stay collectible for the 4x4 market. Same goes for the FJ Cruiser, although I feel like the styling might start to look a bit too bulbous in the future, since the black fenders are almost entirely absorbed by the body panels on top of them. 

The MR2 Spyder has a chance, but I feel like it will always be second place to serious mid-engine cars like the Elise. It would have to have a 914-like appreciation to have any chance of longevity. Same goes for the Celica, where the final generation will be overshadowed by Honda's performance models of the time.

Also, the Volvo C30 might see a resurgence. It feels a bit like a modern P1800 in terms of styling, and is just a fun car overall. The largest challenge to this is how uncommon and easily-forgotten they are - something I personally hope stays that way, so I can get one cheap in the future.",reddit_cars

"I have a feeling this is more lip service and for attention than anything else. 

If you look at the Lotus engine suppliers, there is no viable solution to doing this without a major reworking of the structure of the car. 

The engine bay in the Emira is designed for a transverse engine and transmission arrangement.  It's just a front wheel drive architecture moved to the rear of the vehicle.  The engine bay is fairly short front to back, but has adequate width from side to side.  

The problem with either a Lexus V8 or the Mercedes 4.0 V8 is that both engines are far too wide to fit in the engine bay transversely.  The Lexus is an enormous engine.  The Mercedes is a hot-V arrangement, but it's still a 90 degree engine with overhead cams.  It's much wider than the Toyota V6 that has a 60 degree angle.  It just won't fit in that engine bay.  The only V8 engines that have a chance of fitting back there transversely are pushrod V8s.  These days, that means you only have a couple options.  You could go with an LS/LT engine (the best choice), a Hemi (although these have larger heads and might not fit), or the Ford 6.8/7.3 engine.  The other option, but it would take some reworking of the engine, is to see if they can snatch up the old Rover V8 tooling.  That engine is remarkably light and small.  

Then you have the problem of a transmission.  Lotus has already struggled somewhat to find transmissions for these cars (if I recall correctly, the manual in the Evora and Emira is a Toyota manual used in a Japan market diesel delivery van).  I am not aware of any off the shelf transmissions that are available that can support the kind of power or torque these engines would make that fits transversely in a car.  That goes for both the Lexus and the Mercedes.  

The other alternative is to move to a longitudinal arrangement on the engine.  Doing that would require a complete re-working of the rear structure of the car.  Lotus did go from a 4 to an 8 cylinder in the Esprit, but that car was longitudinal from the start.  

Of course, you could overcome any of these challenges with enough money.  But that's one thing Lotus doesn't seem to have much of, ever.",reddit_cars

"(the Vantage is only a 4 liter? Wow. Anyway...)

You know what the Emira needs instead of a bigger engine?

A 400 kg weight reduction, *at least*. You can't tell me a LOTUS weighs more than your average sedan. Some people will say ""oh they struggled to sell lightweight cars before, so they need the luxury and the...blah blah blah"".

Bullshit. You know how many Alpine A110's Renault has sold? *25 thousand.* You know how many Evoras Lotus sold, IN TOTAL? Less than 7 thousand. Now, the Emira is more successful than that, I believe something like 10 thousand have already been sold, which is good...but then you also have successful lightweight cars like...the Mazda Miata...and nothing needs to be said about that. Expensive, or cheap, the market is there, and you can't tell me there aren't a bunch of Miatas out there that cost Lotus money. But even if there weren't any...ALPINE A110.

I'd add another factor for any car speculator to consider: The curse of the thinly traded item. Roughly speaking, this means how big the market is, and how many of these items are selling per year. Let's imagine you have paid $1m for an extremely rare car that nobody has heard of. Let's call it a Studemaster-Bakersville 500, that was only available with the four speed SloppoTron transmission for one year. Let's then imagine that you finances go south and you need to sell this thing today. How many people are in the market, right now, this second, for your Studemaster?

It's one of the reasons I would only invest in something like a Porsche 911. Thousands of them change hands every month, everyone knows what they are, and there's also a slight bit of wiggle room in terms of variant.

"Counterpoints:

Mercedes is making a V8 63 model with the upcoming CLE63, and there is already a CLE53 AMG. The CLE is essentially an E-Class coupe, so if they’re doing a 53 and 63 in those, it’s reasonable to presume they will in other versions of the E-Class too. 

I also disagree that the existence of an E63 makes the E53 obsolete. The W213 E-Class had an E53 and an E63 version. The GLE also had (has?) both 53 and 63 versions. Historically, the only car I can think of that had a 53 version but not a 63 was the E-Class coupe, which was a niche product to the point where it and the C coupe have been consolidated into one model, the CLE. 

Finally, Mercedes surely sees the demand for a fast V8 performance wagon, given the relative popularity of the S213 E63. Plus, the RS6 Avant is doing well, and BMW is finally bringing an M5 wagon to the US, which is surely a sign of demand. I don’t see why Mercedes would pull out of the very segment that they demonstrated demand for. That said, I don’t see why they’d think a 4cyl C63 is a good idea, so maybe I’m wrong here.",reddit_cars

The new M5 wagon has been at a take rate of **50%** of new M5 sales.

AMG has owned the crown of fast v8 wagon in the states since 2003; perhaps a brief contest with the CTSV.

Now, more so than any time in history, the E63 wagon would make sense and sell well.

There's almost certainly a delay due to the abject stupidity MB and most other automakers of the 2021-2024 era that made them think dumping V8's to go hybrid/EV was the only path forward.

"Is AMG doing worse than RS and M worldwide or in the US in terms of sales?

I agree. MB licking their wounds and moving on. Go with a strong six and call it a day.,reddit_cars
I think they found a market opportunity for more performance wagons. Audi and BMW already offer exclusively V8s. They increase sales volume by offering the I6 model and they could make the V8 limited. Ford does it with the Raptor and Raptor R.,reddit_cars
It's not a big deal to have two high end wagons in the US. These are niche expensive cars and wont cost any extra to import. A V8 E63 with a plug in hybrid is almost certainly coming. The CLE63 is a firm indicator of that. My guess is they need to develop some sort of hybrid component because the original plan was the inline 6 they've now taken for the C63. It will weigh as much as the moon like the M5 but at least it will have the right number of cylinders for a true AMG.,reddit_cars

The biggest problem with the e-ray, as you said, is that gm also makes the z06. Had that not been on the market it would get so much more attention",reddit_cars
Thank you for this. I'm currently in my own head back and forth between a stingray and eray. I appreciate your perspective.,reddit_cars
"Owned both at the same time (not intentionally). Agreed with your sentiment about the ""whole different car"" thing. If GM sold the stingray with an optional z06/eray engine/drive trains, nobody would make a big deal. But because of marketing, people really are over dramatic about their niches. They're both Corvettes, and both do the Corvette thing exactly the same. The only difference being the sound and way they propel themselves and very slightly the way the car turns in.


I wouldn't say the z06 has sharper turn in though. In sport or track the rack is waaaay to slow on the road, I always have the steering set to tour and even then it's not as quick or precise as some others. 


The erays torque really only comes into play at those low rpm high gear instances where you just want to move a bit quicker without kicking down (highway maneuvers). Other wise the z06 doesn't have a problem getting out of it's own way. 300ftlbs off idle is stupid strong for a NA engine or any engine for that matter. Don't have to drive crazy.


Like you though I agree the Eray feels like what the stingray was suppose to be, just feels like a more complete version. The problem is the price is just too close to z06.


I actually traded my Eray in because I thought the cars were too redundant in their function. The z06 just felt more special because of the sound and behavior of the flat plane.",reddit_cars

I wonder if all the designers, engineers, test drivers, product planners, marketing analysts *genuinely* wanted (and recommended) a V8 & the accountant-driven, spiritless managers simply ignored. 

Or was there a genuinely mutual consensus that this car should only be 4cylinders

I want to understand the thought process. I want to understand the opposing powers & debates. I want to understand who is ultimately responsible. 

I find it unbelievable that its competitors (Audi and BMW) still use 6cyl and even 5cyl engines yet Mercedes thought 4cyl would be appealing enough...

To be fair, the 190E equivalent of a C63 back in the day (the 2.3-16v Cosworth) had a 4cyl engine while bigger 6cyls were available even within the W201 chassis. But so did the E30 M3, Sierra Cosworth, etc.

I wonder why that is? It could be that fitting a V8 into a bay designed for a hybrid 4 pot would be very difficult.

It could be something do with compliance and testing for a whole new engine which could make it economically unfeasable.

"Florida doesn’t really give a s*** and will let you import almost anything, people were bringing R34’s there way before the 25 year exemption. However this doesn’t mean they are Federally legal, and you can get into hot water later.",reddit_cars
I saw a black on black one in the parking lot of a diner with Florida plates in NJ. Even I question the legality of it.,reddit_cars
Was it ever sold in Canada? I’ve seen some c43 wagons for sale here that originated in Canada.,reddit_cars
"There are a couple of ways. Just a few:

1) Actually do the work to federalize it. Change out all the lighting and airbags, change the gauge and warning code to US spec, bring the engine to US spec with emissions equipment and coding. The car comes in on bond and is remanded to an authorized conversion shop, and upon completion it gets visual and mechanical inspection.  I went through this process 25 years ago, it’s not cheap but worthwhile if you really want it. 

2) Be a foreign citizen moving to the US for an extended period under a work visa. There’s a program that allows foreign citizens to bring their cars with them. They are *supposed to* go back when the visa is over but, at least a few years ago, there wasn’t a mechanism to enforce that. As the cars needed to be registered and insured in the US, they were issued US titles… and some states were a little loose on allowing those cars to be sold to Americans. Once it had a title for that resale, it could be sold into any other state. I know this firsthand because I bought a car exactly through that process but was lied to about the legality of it and the legality of the conversion (nothing had been done). I bought it in good faith that it was legal. That guy had a whole racket of doing that and spent a few years in prison. The federal authorities were good to us victims, let us keep the cars with the strong request that we federalize them, although not requiring it. 

3) Sneak the car in, re-VIN with the number from a wrecked US car. Illegal as hell, I do not suggest you do that. 

There are other ways also, some temporary, some of questionable legality. Although I too would love to have a CLS63 Shooting Brake, I’d settle for a legal Panamera Sport Turismo wagon. That’s also a beautiful car with potentially an overall superior driving experience. I get the interest - that car of mine that was sold to me illegally was a BMW M5 Touring.",reddit_cars
"Just because something is federally illegal, doesn't mean it can't be registered in a state. SC will register anything with a title and insurance, and never has to lay eyes on the actual vehicle. We had plenty of R34 skylines running around back in the day before they were legal.",reddit_cars
"A guy a know has a Euro spec, as in the menu system is in German/speedometer in kilometers, BMW M3 e46. A German diplomat that worked at the consulate in San Francisco brought it into the US that he bought it from and our states DMV registered it.",reddit_cars
"i know getting montana plates used to be the go-to for registering vehicles in a lenient state. might be how they did it, pretty sure they closed that loophole recently.",reddit_cars
"If I had to take a wild guess the car is registered as the sedan CLS63 AMG. 

They either swapped the vin from a salvage titled sedan CLS63 (easy) OR took the internals of a sedan CLS63 and mated it to the wagon body (hard). I assume the prior is what happened.",reddit_cars
possibly a gray market import that was federalized,reddit_cars
If it had Montana plates it most likely came through curated. Appears you have a bit to learn about exactly how much car fanatics will pay for what they want in Miami.,reddit_cars

"In the OP of the CLS, spotted it in Ponte Vedra, just south of Jax Beach. Could it live here?",reddit_cars
"I've seen the same model running around in Ontario, only 1 of those here that gets posted on spotting pages. The car is on Mexico plates so I'm assuming it was just driven up here from Mexico",reddit_cars
I mean I've seen a pretty new RHD Nissan Micra and a brand new VW Savajero here in Florida multiple times just driving around. The authorities just don't give a fuck here.,reddit_cars
Montana plate on this car in Florida is the most shocking part of this story.,reddit_cars
Yes they did. For like two years they were available,reddit_cars
They sold them in the us a few years ago,reddit_cars
"I'm interested to see what they do. The entire thing with AMG, they were rarely the best objectively performing cars but they put out a damn good engine note and had plenty of character. EV is the antithesis to what the w204 c63 stood for.

They've been trying to push a more technically advanced but less characterful lineup with the c63e, amg-one, putting that boost i4 in everything. It's not going well for them in terms of sales. But it's not like they have much of an option with eu regulations.

What is annoying, they were the ones who made the EQXX, Maybach 6, ATVR concepts. They know how to make a good looking electric car. And then for some unimaginable reason they decided to go with a bar of soap",reddit_cars
They used the C111 sperm bank for that one.,reddit_cars
"Considering the 111 concept can't hold a candle to the C111-II, I'm mildly concerned they're not just pretending it never existed.  And as I'll never afford this car the looks are all I can really care about",reddit_cars
lol you old heads in the replies are offended by everything huh?,reddit_cars
"If they can also get the efficiency similar to their EQXX concept car, that woukd be mega.  I think it got 7 kWh/100km (or 9 miles /kWh).",reddit_cars
Mercedes and audi could learn a thing or two from bmw going forward. Been down the oast years but if they rally behind a vision i think bmw can lead the germans to a new offensive(on the market),reddit_cars
"considering their successful C63 4 cylinder, i wonder how a full EV AMG is gonna go.   
At least the concept is inspired by a very ambitious car that i hold close to my heart. 

  
I hope the EV AMG is close to the concept, then someone will(should) put a wankel in it haha.",reddit_cars
"Oh, it's offensive alright.",reddit_cars
It looks like a vacuum. German designers are smoking crack.,reddit_cars
"> AMG EV Supercar Concept to Lead a Mercedes Product Offensive

Very interested.

> The concept will preview the powertrain that will underpin the dedicated AMG electric sedan and SUV that are due in the next two years.

Nevermind, I'm not interested anymore.

I know volume models should be the first box to check. But I'd love something to lust after. There isn't a single electric supercar in the pipeline from any brand with a US presence - not that they want to publicly share anyway. I had hoped for something like a successor to the electric SLS. But I'll have to keep waiting until the next decade most likely.",reddit_cars
