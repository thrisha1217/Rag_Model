And it looks like? What does the car look like?,AK54B3MMIT4
"❤❤❤❤😮😮It is my favorite German monster, the icon of German cars, Mercedes MG, the monster and the king of the streets and narrow roads, my lost love The video filming us shocked me as if it had not happened",AK54B3MMIT4
"The crazy part is.... You&#39;ll have people who would crash this very car mid lap, calling Hamilton washed up 😂😂😂😂",AK54B3MMIT4
Zwei Werbungen vor dem Video und Lewis spricht direkt am Anfang von Untersteuern. Genau mein Humor,AK54B3MMIT4
lovely,AK54B3MMIT4
That’s the best 360 can I’ve seen .,AK54B3MMIT4
No seatbelts? I don&#39;t feel safe.,AK54B3MMIT4
Copiloting with Lewis Hamilton is my dream ! <br>Definitely in cloud Mercedes AMG 😊♥️👍🏻,AK54B3MMIT4
Bin froh das der bald weg ist.,AK54B3MMIT4
"You also thought camera was placed locked into the passenger dash, didnt you?  😅😂",AK54B3MMIT4
Welches Dummbrot macht da Musik drunter?,AK54B3MMIT4
Thank you 🎉,AK54B3MMIT4
You just had to ruin the whole thing with the music.,AK54B3MMIT4
became a passenger of pro Sir Lewis Hamilton,AK54B3MMIT4
Prefers Ferraris 😊,AK54B3MMIT4
Does he drive a 2 pedal car with both feet? So smooth.,AK54B3MMIT4
American has a hundred lewis hamilton rapper wanna be,AK54B3MMIT4
Crrrrrrrrazyyyyy cam 👌<br>Took me a while to figure it out 😉,AK54B3MMIT4
&quot;This is quicker than my F1 car!&quot;,AK54B3MMIT4
ohhhhh thats why my R7 6800H is going all crazy while playing this video...sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh,AK54B3MMIT4
nice,AK54B3MMIT4
Sounds like old school hip hop playing in the background.,AK54B3MMIT4
"Lewis, heard the SF90XX Stradale is a decent car aswell 😉",AK54B3MMIT4
Repeat offender alert 😆 😂 😆,AK54B3MMIT4
Is there an abandoned Cuckoo on board? 🙄,AK54B3MMIT4
A bit of understeer. When is a driver not beetching about understeer?,AK54B3MMIT4

Toto they don’t listen to me rebuilt this piece of shit. Lulu won 6 tittles with thanks to the illegal development of the engine &amp; thanks to the corrupt FIA,AK54B3MMIT4
awkward,AK54B3MMIT4
faster than w15,AK54B3MMIT4
I would love to have a driver like him give an unbiased review of the AMG GT vs the Porsche 911,AK54B3MMIT4
"Damn, cant imagine how feelings to sat near the Champ in the fast car. This is incredible!",AK54B3MMIT4
cool,AK54B3MMIT4
He definitely is biased or anything,AK54B3MMIT4
Probably last time he did that,AK54B3MMIT4
Does driving for Ferrari effect being a Merc ambassador after?,AK54B3MMIT4
the giggle at the end lol,AK54B3MMIT4
Wouahouh !,AK54B3MMIT4

Superb Lewis you&#39;re the best of all time,AK54B3MMIT4
Please send real visuals,AK54B3MMIT4
Awkward lol.,AK54B3MMIT4
This is the last year with him playing in Mercedes cars; next year he will be playing in Ferraris.,AK54B3MMIT4
"Who else cant wait for endless Ferraris being shaken down? Yeah boi, we&#39;re here for it.",AK54B3MMIT4
Probably the last time when we are seeing Lewis on this channel,AK54B3MMIT4
I can imagine how boring this must be for Lewis🥱,AK54B3MMIT4
"I&#39;m not sure, but I think the balance on the way in might be good.",AK54B3MMIT4
"Hard left, don&#39;t cut!",AK54B3MMIT4
Better than his W14.,AK54B3MMIT4
The video was great but I&#39;m not impressed by the interior. It&#39;s exactly the same as the other cars in the Mercedes linup for this year.,AK54B3MMIT4
Look at how happy Lewis looks while driving it probably faster than w14!,AK54B3MMIT4
I wanted to buy a Merc but with sir Lewis leaving the team .. I am buying Ferrari for sure,AK54B3MMIT4
Does anyone know if it was 12 or 13 degrees today?,AK54B3MMIT4
"The way he got that front end to bite @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK54B3MMIT4&amp;t=20"">0:20</a> and go nose-in to the corner was amazing. Getting the front end of a car to bite like that while transitioning into a descending grade is not easy. You got to know how to make a car behave.",AK54B3MMIT4
"You sure do have an eye for talent, Johnnie! ",AK54B3MMIT4
Your boy loves your shit so much that he&#39;s bailing on you! That says it all. Never 8.,AK54B3MMIT4
"Lewis great move going to Ferrari, one final push for a championship with everybody&#39;s dream machine...Lets get it",AK54B3MMIT4
Who’s here after Lewis joined Ferrari ?,AK54B3MMIT4
Has the driver tried rapping? I think he could be a successful rapper.,AK54B3MMIT4
He actually featured on a christina aguilera song in 2018,AK54B3MMIT4
"This guy looks promising. He should try F1 sometime. Im thinking, Ferrari?",AK54B3MMIT4
Video saved for whenever i wanna go on a drive with sir  lewis when im feeling a bit down.,AK54B3MMIT4
That’s no Ferrari!,AK54B3MMIT4
This camera view is incredible,AK54B3MMIT4
"Does Hamilton have to return all the cars you guys gave him basically for free, now that he is with Ferrari",AK54B3MMIT4
Will be a ferrari now :D,AK54B3MMIT4
You should give this to Max to take for a test drive,AK54B3MMIT4

I never buy Bridgestone Potenza Sport tyres again they just fall so fast after 3 laps,AK54B3MMIT4
This feels like Lewis describing all the qualities that the W14 lacks,AK54B3MMIT4
I can watch and listen to Sir Lewis driving around narrating all day in any car,AK54B3MMIT4
I’m just turned the screen to the left and staring at Sir Lewis the whole time LOL,AK54B3MMIT4
"Same. The laser focus was nice to watch. He was overdoing his excitement though. But to be fair, I understand. When one drives F1 cars for so long I can imagine that you are going to need A LOT to get you going.",AK54B3MMIT4
smooth operator 🎉,AK54B3MMIT4

"weak, lazy and cheap interior",AK54B3MMIT4
I looked down and... where are my legs!!!??? 😅,AK54B3MMIT4
"I like how he pretend to be impressed haha. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is a fast car for normal people, but it&#39;s a turtle compare to what he uses to.",AK54B3MMIT4
You can tell how bored he is,AK54B3MMIT4
Lewis is enjoy and having fun with this car.,AK54B3MMIT4

"What does he say to the fact that it gained around 300kg with the &quot;new version&quot;, that is effectively not an AMG GT anymore. It is another big 4WD elephant and not a sports car anymore. An incredibly beautiful elephant, but not an AMG GT anymore. Too bad.",AK54B3MMIT4

"Wow, get in there GOAT ! Sincerely hope you have a great Christmas and New Year and that the guys can produce a super fast, super light, super compliant car that you can genuinely challenge for a title in. Also, I&#39;ve been into F1 for over four decades - Just a word of advise, whenever you have a certain individual behind you, who will dive bomb through anywhere that looks even remotely like a gap, please place your car in the middle,! never ever leave lots of space on either side, especially as you approach a corner, otherwise they will go for it, regardless, no matter how late, or unrealistic, they will force you off, they dont care, and you know who I mean 😉 you are super clean, they are overly aggressive and would rather a coming to, than see you stay ahead so be mindful GOAT (F1/FIA have shown they wont reign certain folk in, when they should have.) 🙏💪🔥",AK54B3MMIT4
